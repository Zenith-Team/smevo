**A platform for NSMBU custom code**

# Our goal
The goal of this project is to provide a platform for New Super Mario Bros. U custom code for modders with the same toolset that Nintendo developers had when writing the game. We also have provided a ton of code examples and premade patches for new modders to learn from and for people who would just like to use them in their own personal mods. Additionally, it serves as a unification of multiple code hack projects in order to have a project with everything. All credits linked at the bottom of this README.

Project started on March 9, 2021.

# Contributing
Just create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tsuru/pulls) on the designated page. We will review the PR and accept it if we feel that it meets our quality standard and design philosophy. If you have discovered an issue or bug, [create an issue](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tsuru/issues) instead (Suggestions may also go on issues).

# Building
This project is intended to be compiled with the [Tachyon](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tachyon) build system. Keep in mind that currently this project targets version 1.3.0 of the standalone copy of New Super Mario Bros. U, but does maintain compatibility with the DLC as well. Support for the bundle will be coming soon but as of right now it is not our top priority.

# Usage
To install Tsuru onto your game, simply use the [Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.nsmbu.net) patch file installer, and the latest patch available on the [Tsuru releases page](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tsuru/releases).
